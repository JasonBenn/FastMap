<p>Did you know that you can add multiple waypoints to Google Maps?</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to run several errands in a day, you can see how this might be useful.  This feature would be especially useful if Google also advised you on the best route through these waypoints. </p>

<p>No such luck, weirdly enough: Google Maps does <i>not</i> have a button that calculates the quickest route through all of your destinations.  Crazy, right?  You can still approximate a better route by dragging waypoints around until the order looks right, and I've done it, but that's a bit of a pain in the ass (first world problems).

<p>So, to use: type in your addresses or click on the map (the app automatically finds the nearest navigable address).  Drag and drop two of the lime green address boxes into the "first waypoint" and "last waypoint" areas so the app knows where to start and finish.  Then click Optimize Waypoints, and <i>shazam!</i>  Your directions appear.</p>

<p>I hope you find this practical!  It's equally as useful for planning errands as it is for planning a trip around Europe.  If you have any feature or even style suggestions please email me at <a href="mailto:jasoncbenn@gmail.com">jasoncbenn@gmail.com</a>.

<p>This app was built in Ruby and Sinatra using the Google Maps API, jQuery animations, and object-oriented JavaScript.</p>
