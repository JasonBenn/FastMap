<p>Did you know that you can add multiple waypoints to Google Maps?</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to run several errands in a day, you can see how this might be useful.  This feature would be especially useful if Google also advised you on the best route through these waypoints. </p>

<p>No such luck, weirdly enough: Google Maps does <i>not</i> have a button that calculates the quickest route through all of your destinations.  Crazy, right?  You can still approximate a better route by dragging waypoints around until the order looks right, and I've done it, but that's a bit of a pain in the ass <i>(first world problems)</i>.  Much more importantly, however, this is obviously an opportunity to build a wicked sweet WEB APP!!</p>

<p>Finding the shortest route between a given set of cities is called the Traveling Salesman Problem.  It involves calculating distances between points and working out a path that touches all waypoints exactly once.  There's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">wikipedia page</a> with some pretty cool GIFs on it, if you're curious.</p>

<p>So, to use <i>[anyone have a good name suggestion??]</i>, type in your addresses or click on the map (the app automatically finds the nearest navigable address).  Drag and drop two of the lime green address boxes into the "first waypoint" and "last waypoint" areas so the app knows where to start and finish.  Then click Optimize Waypoints, and <i>shazam!</i>  Your directions appear.</p>

<p>I hope you find this practical!  It's equally as useful for planning errands as it is for planning a trip around Europe.  If you have any feature or even style suggestions please email me at <a href="mailto:jasoncbenn@gmail.com">jasoncbenn@gmail.com</a>.  If you're so inclined, the source is available at my <a href="https://github.com/JasonBenn/FastMap">GitHub</a> page.</p>

<p>This was a super fun web app to build.  It took about two days and involved diving into the Google Maps API, jQuery animations, and object-oriented JavaScript.  Week 6 also ended today, meaning I'm now halfway done with <a href="www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>...!  It also means that I first encountered JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Sinatra, HTML, and CSS slightly less than three weeks ago, which is a little nuts.  I love this place!</p>
